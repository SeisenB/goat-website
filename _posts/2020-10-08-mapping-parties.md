The Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning organizes frequently Mapping Parties with the motivation to actively improve the quality of [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), which is the most prominent example of an open and crowd-sourced geographic dataset.

OSM-data is widely used by planners, geographers, and developers, for different purposes. However, little contributions are made by these groups to the OSM-project, mostly due to lack of knowledge of how easy it is to contribute. We want to change that and encourage users, who have not contributed to OSM before, to become part of this vibrant community. Thanks to simple mobile apps and web tools, everybody can easily contribute without prior knowledge on OSM.

The Mapping Parties always start with a short general introduction to OSM, the applications and the tools used for the mapping process. Then the participants are assigned to small groups and different mapping areas. The mapping contest takes place in different parts of the city and runs for about two hours. Afterwards we have a get-together where the contributions are quantified and the winners are announced. In previous years, this took place in person, in beautiful places like the English Garden in Munich.

Even this year is not an exception, we organized a very successful Mapping Party on the 24th of September. Due to the current pandemic regulations, we mapped remotely from home, using the [GOAT Mapping Mode](https://www.open-accessibility.org/docs/mapping_mode/) to identify objects with missing attributes and extract the relevant information from aerial images and [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) pictures, or in small groups of 2-3 people in the field with smartphone apps such as [Go Map!!](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/go-map/id592990211) and [StreetComplete](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetcomplete&hl=de&gl=US). The introduction and get-together took place via zoom.

Over 25 participants from different organizations, such as [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), [Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg](https://tu-freiberg.de/en/university), [MunichWays](https://www.munichways.com/) and the [OSM-Community](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Join_the_community) were part of this event. Together we  edited over 1,000 objects (e.g. cycleways, Points-of-Interest, buildings) and 1,700 attributes in 2 hours of mapping. As the focus on this Mapping Party was to improve the data of the cycleways and Points-of-Interests, ‘surface’, ‘opening_hours’ and ‘segregated’ were some of the most mapped attributes.
