  description: Geo Open Accessibility Tool, or simply GOAT, is an open-source web tool that is interactive, flexible, and practical for accessibility planning. Currently under development at the startup [Plan4Better](https://plan4better.de/) and the [Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM](https://www.bgu.tum.de/sv/startseite/), GOAT is capable of modeling walking and cycling accessibility. Frequent enhancements are made to improve its performance and add additional functionality. 

project:
  title: Why use GOAT?
  image: isochrone_amenities.png
  description: There is rising awareness that active mobility plays a vital role in urban transport systems. However, to date there are few planning instruments that are focusing on walking and cycling. GOAT as an accessibility tool is therefore designed to model walking/cycling accessibility and serve as a suitable instrument for easier, better, and more open transport and urban planning.

  description: The main focus of GOAT is to offer dynamic accessibility analysis at the street, neighborhood, and district level. With GOAT, you can calculate different accessibility indicators such as isochrones and gravity-based heatmaps. What is special about GOAT is that you can develop your own case scenarios. For instance, you can model the effects of a new bridge or new housing development on accessibility.
