If you find a POI with missing information in GOAT, you can edit it in OSM-database by clicking the "Edit with OSM" icon. 

{% include image.html src="docs/contribute_to_OSM/OSM_POIs.png" alt="Link to OSM" title="Link to OSM" %}

This takes you directly to the corresponding POI in OSM iD Editor. 

{% include image.html src="docs/contribute_to_OSM/OSM_edit_POI.png" alt="Edit the POI in OSM" %}

Now you can enter the missing information or change information if it is incorrect. Save your changes as described in [Making changes in OSM](../osm_tutorial/).
